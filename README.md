# File Organizer :file_folder:
It's a :snake: script that organizes a specific folder by creating subfolders using the extensions of the different files and than moving them to the corresponding folder, for example : <br>
    the file "example.txt"
    will be moved into a folder named "txt" <br>
A simple way of keeping your folders organized :wink:
